  This class constitutes the default implementation of the temporal pooler (TP).
  The main goal of the TP is to form stable and unique representations of an
  input data stream of cell activity from a Temporal Memory. More specifically,
  the TP forms its stable representation based on input cells that were
  correctly temporally predicted by Temporal Memory.

  If this active cell input sequence was not predicted, a competition,
  similar to that of the Spatial Pooler's, is used to select active
  TP cells. Note that while the temporal pooler functions like a
  Spatial Pooler in that it selects a sparse active set of columns,
  these columns are treated as if they only have one cell, and will be referred
  to as TP cells.

  If a TP cell is sufficiently activated by inputs that were predicted by the
  Temporal Memory, it enters into a "pooling state." A pooling cell can, for a
  limited period, maintain its active status even if it does not receive any
  bottom-up input activity. This is implemented using a timer for each cell.
  When the timer "runs out," the cell loses its pooling status. Whenever
  significant active predicted input overlaps with a TP cell's proximal
  synapses, its timer is reset.

    Determines each column's overlap with predicted active cell input.
    If learning, overlap is calculated between predicted active input cells and
    potential synapses. Otherwise, connected synapses are used.
    The overlap of a TP cell that was previously active and has one or more
    active synapse due to predicted active input is set to (_numInputs + 1).
    This guarantees that such a cell wins the inhibition competition.
    
    TODO: check with Jeff, what happens in biology if a cell was not previously
    active but receives metabotropic input?  Does it turn on, or does the met.
    input just extend the activity of already active cells? Does it matter
    whether the synapses are connected or not? Currently we are assuming no
    because most connected synapses become disconnected in the previous time
    step. If column i at time t is bursting and performs learning, the synapses
    from t+1 aren't active at time t, so their permanence will decrease.
